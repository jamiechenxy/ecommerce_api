# E-Commerce API

This project is based on personal practicing purpose. The target is to build a preliminary version of a fully-functioning e-commerce application REST API that allows users to perform various CRUD operations such as registering an account, browsing products for sale, etc.

## Summary

The essential concept of this project is just like e-commerce platform in real life, users' privacy and safety are much accounted.
As a result, most functionality required authentication before it can be accessed to a user. Thus, registration is necessary.
Furthermore, just like similar projects in read life, some operations are done behind the scene for the convenience of users. For an instance, cart is created and removed from the database automatically when items added into a cart and checkout respectively.

## Endpoint

All the endpoints names in this project start with:

>**/api**

### Endpoint of categories

The overview below introduces functions and name of each endpoint.

Allow user to browse information of products:

>**/product**

Authentication:
>**/auth**

Allow user to view and modify own information:
>**/user**

Get access to user's own cart:
>**/cart**

Allow users to retrieve their own records of orders:
>**orders**

For more details about API such as sub-level endpoints, requests and responses etc, please refer to yaml.

## Future Development

As you can see it,  this project is just backend. With development of frontend, other critical functions will be added to this backend part and, certainly, connection with the frontend part.

## At Last

Learning how to code is so much fun. Looking forward to my next project. :zany_face:
